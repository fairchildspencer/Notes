# Single Function Utilities - Modular Digital Experience

Over the last two years I have slowly seen my opinions on day to day software change.
Two years ago I was finishing my last semester of college and didn't put a whole lot of thought into the software that ran my life.
There are a few core pieces of software that I use constantly:

- Email
- Text Editor
- Web Browser

In 2022 I started giving considerable thought to my digital life and how cluttered and chaotic it felt.
I discovered a beautifully quirky little device called the LightPhone II and decided to give it a try.

Using a phone that only had a few basic utilities had a number of interesting effects on my life.
The most interesting effect was actually one that lasted even after I started using a smartphone again.
I had a desire to use software that did one thing very well instead of doing many things sort of well.

This is a concept that I originally learned from modular synthesis.
When building a modular synth, the typical advice is to put together a system made of "single function utilities".
Or pieces of the system that do one thing exceptionally well.
This allows you to have a more flexible system that can be patched together in any number of ways.

After using the light phone I realized this idea could be applied to my digital life.
I started searching for pieces of software that were created to do one thing very well.
This resulted in me finding software that was not created by big tech companies, i've found that big tech tends to build products that are bloated with too many features.

My first stop on this journey was finding a new browser, enter **Arc**.
Arc has been around for a couple years now and lots of people are using it.
I started using Arc in March 2023.
I was drawn to Arc by it's fresh take on browsing the internet.
They went all in on crafting a digital experience that felt sleek and simple.
They are making the act of browsing the internet a better experience.
They also didn't choose to do everything, they built their browser on chromium, which made it so they could focus on doing one thing very well, crafting a great user experience.
Arc is a prime example of building a single function utility, even though a browser has to accomplish a lot, Arc constantly strives to stay simple.
The Arc team has even taken this to another level recently by "unshipping" features that don't feel useful.
They are seeking to build one thing, the best way to interact with the internet.

After switching to Arc, my internet browsing experience became significantly less chaotic.
This resulted in a huge contrast with the experience I was having in my text editor, my other most used software.
During college a started using VSCode as my text editor, as it was the most common text editor for web development.
VSCode began to feel clunky to me as I started working full time as a software engineer.
Something about it felt slow and bloated with features.
I constantly felt like I was fighting with it to look and feel how I wanted.
I also kept discovering new features and sections of the program that felt weird or unnecessary.
I started looking into other options and ended up landing on an editor that I briefly experimented with in college: **Neovim**.
When I first picked up Neovim in college it was because I watched a video where someone had set it up to look really slick and I wanted a cool looking editor (yeah, I know).
It didn't stick that time because I wasn't looking to switch for the right reasons.
I also didn't really have the time to learn a whole new ecosystem/set of keybindings.
When I picked it back up the second time it was because I was looking to simplify my digital experience.
Neovim was the perfect companion to this mission because it also follows the principles of modular software.
With Neovim, you get the benefits and simplicity of vanilla vim, with the options to extend and customize it by using Lua.
With Neovim I was able to shave off all of the unnecessary bloat in VSCode and build an editor that has everything I want and not a feature more.
Neovim embodies the spirit of doing one thing extremely well, it allows me to write edit text efficiently and that's it.
I don't need specific integrations with every aspect of the development experience, I want a sleek, fast place to write code.
